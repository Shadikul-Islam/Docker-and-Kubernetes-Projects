Today we will setup the Kubernetes environment in the Linux VM. We will use Ubuntu VM. We will seutp k8s in two ways. One way is **One master Node and Multiple worker Node** and the second way is **Master and Worker in the Same VM**. 

In the first way, we will need one VM for the master node and at least two VM for the worker node. Specification of the master node VM will be at least RAM: 4 GB and CPU: 2 core and any specification of the VM can be run worker node.

In the second way, we need just one VM causes the master and the worker will be in the same node. Specification of this VM will be: At least RAM: 4 GB and CPU: 2 core.

Let's do it...
